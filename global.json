  // This empty file has no effect and is here to support Arcade-powered source-build.
  // The Arcade build process requires a global.json at the root of the repo and normally
  // uses it to restore the necessary SDK and tools to build the repo.
  // However, NuGet explitcly wants to use the ambient SDK (normally latest), not any particular
  // version.  We also don't want to introduce MS.DN.Arcade.SDK into the non-source-build build.
  // eng/source-build/global.json has the entry for the Arcade version we need for
  // Arcade-powered source-build.
