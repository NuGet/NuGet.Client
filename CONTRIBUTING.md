# Setup

After you clone this repository run configure.ps1 & build.ps1.

Note that build.ps1 is the only process producing all nuget packages and artifacts, building from visual studio is good for development purposes, but is not enough at the moment.

### Build.ps1 is responsible for the following steps:

1. Update submodules
1. Restore nuget packages
1. Build
1. ilmerge nuget.exe
1. Running all unit tests

# Building in Visual Studio

Follow the instructions in the README.
