# How to Contribute to NuGet

NuGet is an open-source project that the .NET Community depends on and should be able to contribute to.  There are so many edge cases and capabilities that developers want in their package manager that the main development team cannot cover them all.  We actively encourage pull-requests from our engaged community members, but ask that you follow a few simple guidelines to ensure that the NuGet development team can accept your work.


For any change that you wish to submit code, the following steps are required to be taken:

1. Open an issue in the [NuGet/Home repository](http://github.com/nuget/home/issues) that clearly explains the issue you want to address with an example of how the project would benefit from your change
2. Discuss and agree on the issue with the NuGet team
3. Fork the repository that you are working on
3. Write unit-tests that exercise your change to verify the code works as expected
4. Push to your fork on GitHub
3. Submit a pull-request with your code rebased into a single commit that links to the issue in the PR description
4. Sign a contributor license agreement.  A bot will provide one for you when a pull-request is submitted if you do not have one on file.
5. Enjoy!

Documentation submissions for [docs.nuget.org](http://docs.nuget.org) and updates are always welcome, and may be reformatted as necessary to fit the theme and structure of the NuGet documentation.
