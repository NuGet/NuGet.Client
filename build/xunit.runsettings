    <!--
      This setting controls the level of parallelism on process-level. Use 0 to enable the maximum process-level parallelism.

      This setting determines the maximum number of test DLLs, or other test containers that can run in parallel. Each DLL runs in its own testhost process, and is isolated on the process level from the tests in other test DLLs. This setting doesn't force tests in each test DLL to run in parallel. Controlling the parallel execution within a DLL (on the thread-level) is up to the test framework such as MSTest, XUnit or NUnit.

      The default value is 1, meaning that only one testhost runs at the same time. A special value 0 allows as many testhosts as you have logical processors (for example, 6, for a computer with 6 physical cores without multi-threading, or 12, for a computer with six physical cores with multi-threading).

      The number of distinct DLLs in the run determines the actual number of testhosts started.
